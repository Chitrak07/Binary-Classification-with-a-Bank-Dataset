# ðŸ§  Neural Network Model â€“ Kaggle Playground Series S5E8

This project implements a **binary classification neural network** for the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 8](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e8) competition using **TensorFlow** and **scikit-learn**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
- **Goal:** Predict target `y` for given features
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Key Features:**
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
  - Dropout layers for regularization
  - Class imbalance handling using computed weights
  - AUC metric for evaluation
